### MODX Revolution

Revolution is MODX's flagship CMS and application framework, lovingly called "Revo". If you're new to MODX, start here.

Revo delivers lightning-fast page loads on the front end, while keeping a secure backend, by separating many common website functions into Extras (below), and outside of the Revo core. Functionality can also be achieved with php, python or other common languages, often in the form of [Snippets](https://docs.modx.com/revolution/2.x/developing-in-modx/basic-development/snippets). A general rule of thumb is never hack the core, so that nothing gets over-written during an update.

Before installing, have a look at the extras you plan to use, or talk about your needs in the developers forum! Then install Revo and start developing!

### Before Installation

- Languages - For sites that will have content not in English, or will have multi-lingual functions, make sure when installing Revo that your database tables are set to the proper language, such as UTF-8.

### Extras

MODX Extras extend the core functionality of the MODX software. Other CMSs refer to them as "Plugins" or "Modules". Many of the Extras are developed by the MODX core team, while others are by third parties. Although by no means an exhaustive reference, the majority of the most popular Extras are documented here. 

- [Download Extras](http://modx.com/extras/?product=revolution)
- [Learn more about installing Extras](building-sites/extras)
- [E-Commerce](https://modx.com/extras/category/e-commerce) - There are a wealth of Extras to provide a wide-range of commercial functions.
- [Users](https://modx.com/extras/browse/?search=users) - Revo has basic user functionality, with both a user object and user profile object, as well as user classes and roles. For sites that need more robust user data and management, there are some Extras that allow for additional functionality.

## What about MODX Evolution?

Evolution is MODX's classic codebase - the original version released in 2005. [As of April 2017](https://modx.com/blog/evolution-cms-has-a-new-home) Evolution is officially a separate project, no longer under the wings of MODX. That means Evolution has its own leadership, processes, and community.

All information about Evolution, including documentation and extras, can be found at [evo.im](https://evo.im/).
